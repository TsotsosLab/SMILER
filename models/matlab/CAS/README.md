# Context Aware Saliency (CAS)

Context Aware Saliency (CAS) is based on work in the following paper:

```
Stas Goferman, Lihi Zelnik-Manor, and Ayellet Tal (2010). Context-Aware Saliency Detection. CVPR
```

## Important Note

Due to the original study authors releasing only a MATLAB binary rather than the complete code at the time of this writing (July 2015), the code being used is actually implemented by Jyun-Fan Tsai and Kai-Jeuh Chang. The code was written as faithfully as possible according to the algorithm described in the paper, but may have slight differences.

At the time of this writing their implementation is available from: https://sites.google.com/a/jyunfan.co.cc/site/home
